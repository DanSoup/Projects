# CaS - CSS Project 1 - Four Squares
### 26/09/19

Welcome to Code and Stuff CSS Project 1 - Four Squares. In this task you must follow a brief and style a pre-built website. Follow the instructions given below and host the project in your own GitHub Page repository. For instructions on setting up and working in your GitHub Page repository read the [README](README.md) in the root folder of this repository.



Remember to regularly commit your code! When your project is reviewed we will also be viewing your commits.

## Main Tasks

Create a CSS file to style the provided HTML document with the following features:

* A coloured background
* Four identical coloured squares (they must have the same height and width)
* The squares are centered in the document
* The squares change colour when the cursor is hovered over them

## Advanced Tasks

Make these updates to your website by editing the CSS file:

* Make every square a different color
* Arrange the squares in a 2 x 2 grid
* When the square changes colour when it's hovered over have it transition smoothly rather than change instantly

Create a second CSS file and link it to the your HTML file instead of ```index.css```. Add your own ```class``` and/or ```id``` attributes to the HTML file. Your new CSS file should complete all the above tasks using these ```class``` and/or ```id``` attributes.
