# CaS - HTML Project 1 - A Basic Website

Welcome to Code and Stuff HTML Project 1. In this task you must follow a brief and build a website. Follow the instructions given below and host the project in your own GitHub Page repository. For instructions on setting up and working in your GitHub Page repository read the [README](README.md) in the root folder of this repository.

Remember to regularly commit your code!

## Main Task

You must build a single page website to show off an interest you have. This website should have:

* Three sections arranged vertically
  * A heading with the name of your page
  * A main section to contain information about your chosen interest properly laid out with paragraphs and headers
  * A footer containing copyright information, for example "Copyright Â© 2019, Code and Stuff. All Rights Reserved"
* At least one image
* A hyperlink, perhaps to more information
* Any of the following if they are relevant and available:
  * A table of information
  * An embedded video

You should use CSS to style the content to make it readable and attractive.

## Advanced Task

Go through the HTML you've written and make sure it is "semantic". You can read about semantic HTML [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics "Semantics - MDN"). For example, your headings should use the ```<h1-6>``` tags. Semantic HTML makes your website more understandable, not only when you are looking at the code but for things like browsers, search engined and screen readers.
