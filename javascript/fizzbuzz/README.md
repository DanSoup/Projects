# CaS - JavaScript - FizzBuzz
### 26/09/19

Welcome to Code and Stuff "FizzBuzz" JavaScript project. In this task you must follow a brief and write a function. Follow the instructions given below and host the project in your own GitHub Page repository or personal website. For instructions on setting up and working in your GitHub Page repository read the [README](README.md) in the root folder of this repository.

Edit the function in "index.js" and monitor your tests by opening "index.html" in a browser.

Remember to regularly commit your code! When your project is reviewed we will also be viewing your commits.

## Main Tasks

You must write a function "fizzBuzz" that takes a number as an argument and returns a string with the following rules:

* If the number is divisible by three then return "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by five then return "Buzz"
* If the number is divisible by three and five then return "FizzBuzz"
* If the number is not divisible by three and not divisible by five then return the number.

The first three tests have been written for you in "tests.js". You will have to write additional tests for calling your function with integers higher than 3.

## Advanced Tasks

Add additional functionality to your function by having it return "Bang" if it is called with a non-integer value. Remember to write additional tests for the new functionality.
