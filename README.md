# CodeandStuff Projects

Welcoe to the CodeandStuff project repository. This repository contains projects we have created for our CodeandStuff attendees for various languages and technologies.

## Obtaining the Projects

Clone this repository using the following link:

```https://github.com/codeandstuff-manchester/Projects.git```

Then copy the file of the project you want to work on to your GitHub page repository.

When a new project is added or an existing project is updated you can pull this repository to update it.

## Working in your Repository

If you don't have a GitHub Pages repository you will need to set one up by following the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/).

In your GitHub Page repository you should make a folder called "projects" or something similar and add subfolders for each subject (HTML, CSS, etc.). Copy the project folder into the appropriate subject folder.

While working on your repository you should regularly commit your code. This is a good habit to get into and will allow you to go back to a previous version if you make a mistake you can't fix. Generally, code should be committed when you've completed a section. A set of commit messages might look something like this:

* "Wrote the paragraph describing my cat"
* "Added a photo of my cat"
* "Fixed the typos in my cat's description"
* "Updated the title of the page"
* "Changed the background colour to make text more readable"

You can read about some best practices on [this Github page](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices).

## When You Finish

When you have finished your code post in the CodeandStuff Slack in the ```#help``` channel asking for a review. We will look at your code and commit messages and give you feedback. Please remember the mentors do this in their spare time so please be patient when waiting for your review.

If your project passes the review your achievement will be logged.

## Ask for Help!

If you are sturggling with any aspect of the projects don't hesitate to post in the CodeandStuff Slack in the ```#help``` channel. One of the mentors or attendees will point you in the right direction and get you back on track. You can also ask for help during the CodeandStuff meetups.
